# E-GROCERY
## Introduction
Customers may buy groceries and other household supplies online from the convenience of their homes using an e-grocery system. A typical component of this kind of system is an online store or mobile app that sells a variety of goods, such as groceries, home goods, and fresh produce. A number of payment options are accepted when customers browse the available products, add items to their virtual shopping carts, and finish their purchases online. Additionally, e-grocery systems could offer alternatives for curbside pickup or home delivery in addition to order tracking and customer support services. These technologies are intended to make grocery shopping for customers quick and easy, but simultaneously minimizing face-to-face encounters and encouraging social seclusion.
